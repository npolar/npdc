Container repository for http://data.npolar.no, consisting of a number of independent [Angular]-based web applications

Each application is built, tested and deployed via [npdc-gulp](npolar/npdc-gulp), gets common UI and other shared code from [npdc-common], and interacts with the API using [npolar-angular].
See the wiki for more details.
